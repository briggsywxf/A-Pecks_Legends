## Bath Hack 2022 Entrant

A-Pecks Legends is an online multiplayer, PvP shooter game. The game (attempts to) follow a battle royale format - eliminate all other players to win.
Players take on the form of ducks, battling it out on a map based on the Bath Uni campus.

A-Pecks Legends was created in 24 hours for Bath Hack 2022, in collaboration with Simon Balfe, James Johnson, and Jodie Young.

Taking on an online multiplayer game was a huge challenge (with some huge bugs!), but using the Unity Relay service made linking things up substantially more straightforward.

The game was created in Unity game engine, with C# scripting. Assets were created by Jodie using Aseprite.
